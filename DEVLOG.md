# Development log

A chronological record of what was built during the hackathon, what was
checked, and what was decided. Times are IST (UTC+5:30); the hackathon's
official times are US Eastern. Commit hashes link each entry to the history.

## 2026-10-27

### Before the first commit: research only (≈08:00–08:40 IST)

No code written. Read the official documentation to settle API details
before building:

- **Meta Model API**: OpenAI-SDK compatible at `https://api.meta.ai/v1`,
  model `muse-spark-1.3`, `tool_choice` restricted to `"auto"`, raw reasoning
  not returned, 504 on long non-streaming calls.
- **Baseten**: `https://inference.baseten.co/v1`, model
  `meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026`. Muse Spark Open has **no structured
  output**, so both models will return their final answer through a tool call.
  Its reasoning is readable via `reasoning_content` and always on, which can
  exhaust the default 4096 `max_tokens`.
- Organizers confirmed in Discord that using an open-source dependency
  (GroundingBench) is fine.

The organizers announced "Hacking has officially started!" in the hackathon
Discord before the first commit below.

### 08:44 · Skeleton · `1cd51f4`

`LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.env.example`, `README.md`.

- `.gitignore` committed before any key exists on disk. Audited with
  `git check-ignore`: 11 secret/cache paths confirmed ignored (`.env`,
  `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.venv/`, `data/`, caches), 8 source paths
  confirmed tracked, including `.env.example`.
- `.gitattributes` forces LF line endings so Windows editors can't introduce
  CRLF noise into a public repo.
- This commit was made by Claude. From here on Manas makes every commit.

### 08:50 · Packaging · `c01f3bd` (pushed to GitHub)

`pyproject.toml`, `pinpoint/__init__.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`.

- GroundingBench is an **optional** `eval` extra pinned to commit
  `5fd7325`, not a core dependency, so the `pinpoint` package cannot import
  the grader even by accident.
- `tests/test_packaging.py` enforces the label-free rule by parsing every
  source file under `pinpoint/`. Mutation-tested: a planted
  `from env.reward import ...`, `r["smoking_gun_step"]`, and `t.policy_class`
  were each caught; a legitimate relative import was correctly allowed.
- Verified pip installed GroundingBench at exactly `5fd7325`, and that its
  grader reproduces the paper's worked example (grounded 1.5, ungrounded 1.0).
- ruff clean, mypy `--strict` clean, 3 tests pass.

### 08:56 · Evaluation data fetcher · (uncommitted)

`benchmark/__init__.py`, `benchmark/fetch_data.py`, `tests/test_fetch_data.py`.

Downloads the two held-out trace files from GroundingBench at the pinned
commit. Each file must pass a SHA-256 check and a trace-count check; it is
written to a temporary file and moved into place only after both pass, so an
interrupted or tampered download never leaves a plausible-looking file.

**Findings**
- The SHA-256 of the GitHub files differed from the local GroundingBench
  copies. Cause: `core.autocrlf=true` on the Windows checkout stored CRLF
  line endings. After stripping `\r`, the hashes are identical. The script
  pins the canonical LF hashes.
- The pinned commit `5fd7325` is one commit ahead of the local GroundingBench
  checkout; the only difference is the LICENSE copyright line.
  `env/reward.py`, `env/parse.py` and `env/trace_format.py` are byte-identical,
  so benchmark numbers are comparable with the paper's.

**Bugs found in review, fixed before testing**
- The `downloader` default was bound at import time, so tests could never
  redirect `main()` away from the network. Now resolved at call time.
- A connection dropping mid-download (`IncompleteRead`, `SSLError`) was not
  retried and would have surfaced as a raw traceback. Now retried.

**Audit**
- Python floor raised to 3.11 (tests use `tomllib`); mypy now covers
  `pinpoint/`, `benchmark/` and `tests/`.
- ruff clean, mypy `--strict` clean on 5 files, **34 tests pass**, no network
  used by any test.
- Mutation testing: 7 of 7 planted bugs caught (skipped hash check, skipped
  count check, no temp-file cleanup, installing before verifying, retrying
  4xx, trusting an existing file without hashing it, ignoring `--force`).
- Real run: both files downloaded and verified; second run made no network
  calls; a deliberately corrupted file was detected and replaced. All 720
  traces present, classes balanced (30×4 and 150×4).

## Next

- `pinpoint/trace.py`: load a trace without its labels; render steps
  1-indexed.
- `pinpoint/verifier.py`: label-free citation check (step exists, quote
  appears verbatim in that step, quote is non-trivial), integer step matching.
- Once the Meta API key is live: `pinpoint/client.py`, then one trace end to
  end with the raw response saved.
